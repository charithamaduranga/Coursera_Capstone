# AI Capstone Project with Deep Learning
This capstone project was a part of IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate program. The objective of the project was to build an image classifier to classify a given data set of cracked and non-cracked concrete images.  
VGG16 and ResNet50 pre-trained models were used to build two image classifiers and compare the performance of both models using the given image data set.  

#### <ins> Key activities carried out. </ins>
 - Keras ImageDataGenerator class was used to augment the training data and train the model with batches in order to avoid loading entire dataset in to the memory which is inefficient.
 - Build the model ResNet50 and VGG16 models.
 - Predict and evaluate the performance of two models and report the performance.
